beam.rs
=======
Beam.rs is a Rust library that focuses on providing laser projection algorithms.

Are you a laser programmer?
---------------------------

If you program with lasers, I've compiled a small (non-exhaustive) list of
libraries and other references. Back in the early 2010's, there weren't very
many resources for programming with lasers. This has changed quite a bit in
recent years. Here's a list to help you get started.

### Rust laser projection libraries

- [beam.rs](https://github.com/echelon/beam.rs) **[you are here]**, a laser
  projection algorithm library.

- [ilda.rs](https://github.com/echelon/ilda.rs), an ILDA file parser. This reads
  standard ILDA laser projection files.

- [lase.rs](https://github.com/echelon/lase.rs), a Multi-DAC client library
  (only etherdream is supported right now, but more will be added soon).

### Helpful Programs / Utilities

- [Etherdream Emulator](https://github.com/echelon/etherdream-emulator),
  a program that acts as a virtual DAC and visualizes laser projection.

- [Ilda Player](https://github.com/echelon/ilda-player), a program for
  projecting ILDA files.

### Other code of interest

- [Go Ether Dream](https://github.com/tgreiser/etherdream), Tim's Golang
  Ether Dream client library.

- [Laser Asteroids](https://github.com/echelon/laser-asteroids), a game I
  wrote in Python.

- [Laser Graffiti](https://github.com/echelon/laser-graffiti), a novel program
  for drawing lasers with lasers.

- [Laser Pong](https://github.com/echelon/laser-pong), another game I wrote
  in Python.

### Other resources

- [lasers.io](http://lasers.io), my website for laser projection. It will be
  updated with algorithms and a laser programming blog in the future.

- [Photon Lexicon](https://www.photonlexicon.com/forums/), _the_ laser
  projection forum. It's a welcoming community with lots of advice.
